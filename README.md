# NULL Engine

Null Engine is a basic 3D Graphics Engine for game development. It has been developed by a single [Bachelor's degree in Video Game Design and Development](<https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/>) student at [UPC CITM](<https://www.citm.upc.edu/>) [Tech Talent Center](<https://www.talent.upc.edu/cat/school/ttc/>) in Barcelona.

It has been coded from scratch in C and C++ along with the following libraries:

- [Standard Template Library](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library>)
- [Simple DirectMedia Layer](<https://libsdl.org/>)
- [OpenGL v4.6](<https://www.opengl.org/>)
- [Glew v2.1.0](<http://glew.sourceforge.net/>)
- [ImGui v1.79 (Docking Branch)](<https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/docking>)
- [ImGuizmo v1.61](<https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo>)
- [MatGeoLib v1.5](<https://github.com/juj/MathGeoLib>)
- [PhysFS v3.0.2](<https://icculus.org/physfs/>)
- [Parson v1.1.0](<https://github.com/kgabis/parson>)
- [Assimp v3.1.1](<http://www.assimp.org/index.php/downloads>)
- [DevIL v1.8.0](<http://openil.sourceforge.net/download.php>)

### Engine Features

* **Main Menu Bar:** Placed at the top of the window. It has various menu items that allow to exit the engine, open/close editor panels and show some primitive examples.

  ---

* **Toolbar:** Placed at the top of the window, just below the Main Menu Bar. It contains various items such as the Play&Stop buttons. This feature will be further developed when the Play&Stop feature is Implemented.

  ****

* **Configuration Panel:** Placed at the right side of the window. It has multiple collapsing headers that display different values and parameters of each existing module.

  ---

* **Scene Panel:** Placed at the center of the window. It will display the current state of the Engine's 3D environment. In this Panel GameObjects can be selected with the mouse and manipulated through the use of Gizmos.

  ---

* **Game Panel:**  Placed at the center of the window (tab at the right of the Scene Panel).  Will display the Engine's 3D environment while in "Game State". This feature will be further developed when the Play&Stop feature is implemented.

  ****

* **Hierarchy Panel:** Placed at the left side of the window. It shows all the game objects that are currently placed in the current scene. Upon clicking any of them the Inspector panel will show all the components the selected game object has.

  ****

* **Inspector Panel:** Placed at the right side of the window (along with Configuration). It shows the components of a selected game object. The components are Transform, Mesh and Material. 

  Disclaimer: To see all the possible components that a game object can have create an empty game object. Otherwise if a game object was created with an imported model it will only have the components it needs.

  ****

* **Console Panel: ** Placed at the bottom of the window. It outputs information about the state of the engine: Loading&Saving, Importing models and textures...

  ---

* **Project Panel:** Placed at the bottom of the window. It shows all the assets inside the "Assets/" folder. This feature will be developed further when the Resource Manager is implemented.

* ---

  **Load File Panel:** Placed at the center of the window. It is hidden by default, and can be opened with *Ctrl + O*. It will display all the Assets that are inside the "Assets/" folder and allows to select a file and Importing it into the Engine.

  ****

* **Drag&Drop:** In this version of the engine models and textures can be dropped from a directory into the engine. For models this creates a new game object per individual mesh in the model. Moreover, the first mesh to be processed will be set as the parent of the rest. Textures will also be loaded onto the model.

  For textures, if a texture is dropped and a game object is currently being selected/inspected, that texture will be added to it. To try out this feature just go to the Textures folder in Assets and drag and drop the test image (it's a classic).
